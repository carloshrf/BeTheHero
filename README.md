# Welcome to "Be the Hero"
**Be the Hero** is an application developed in the week omnistack 11 offered by **Rocketseat**, the application is based on the registration of incidents by NGOs that are looking for "heroes" who can save each one. 

The backend, frontend and mobile application were developed, is needed to execute **yarn** at the directory root of all projects to download all necessary dependencies. 

To start the services, just execute with a prompt the command **"yarn start"** or **"npm start"** also at the root of each one's directory. In the backend it is necessary to execute an additional command, **"npx knex migrate: latest"** to migrate all the tables to the  **sqlite** database.

In portuguese: ONG (Organização não Governamental)
In english: NGO (Non-governamental Organization)
